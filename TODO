[ ]All
	[ ]file_info() returned information needs to be freed?
	[X]Autmatic selection of text on textfield focus
	[X]Default configuration in /usr/something, which is copied to the user's homedir when first started
	[ ]Memory leaks fix
	[ ]Check for free-ing of color allocation (should this be done?)
	[ ]DirMove has no error checking?
	[ ]'Abort the copy of this dir' fix?
	[ ]Code for 'select_" should be renamed to 'cursor_'
[ ]Operations
	[ ]Overwrite warnings
	[ ]Force overwrite
	[ ]Preserve attributes
	[ ]Progressbar fails when operating on many (small files)
	[ ]Directory deletion (in /home/todsah/fx/) leaves dir sorted wrongly.
	[ ]Progressbaar sometimes does not show the path correctly (String overflow somewhere) instead, it shows garbage.
	[ ]Refresh in dir with lots of traffic locks up nimf.
	[ ]Progressbar dialog does not have a cancel button.
	[ ]Multiple progressbars. 1 for total progress, 1 for current file progress.
	[ ]When no editor is assigned, the default ($EDITOR) should be used.
	[ ]Pattern copy/move ala mmv
	[ ]Delete operations shouldn't move cursor to the top of the list.
	[ ]Delete should have a confirmation panel (optional, settable in config)
	[ ]Read executeds program's exit code's and show std_err if not OK.
[ ]Keys
	[ ]Commandline option for displaying key numbers.
	[ ]Keysyms for:
		[X]Hidden files
		[X]Home
		[ ]Root
		[X]Refreshdir
[ ]Panel
	[ ]A click anywhere in the panel should focus it. 
	[ ]AUto update routine does not take in account change of ownership of files.
	[ ]CD'ing into a rw_rw____ dir (no execute) causes nimf to segfault.
	[ ]Cancle button doesn't work in pattern select dialog.

	[ ]Methode for jumping to next jumpsearch match
	[ ]Move panel_find_row_from_text to gtk_addons.c
	[ ]On creation of a new dir move to this dir in the panel.
	[ ]Recursive dir del resolves symlinks?
	[ ]Refresh directly after reading a new dir causes the cursor to move.
	[ ]Running an action (view/edit) on a file causes the cursor to also be displayed in the other panel after completion.
	[ ]Sort does no keep in mind symlinks which point to dirs when sorting.
	[ ]Toggling hidden (ctrl-h) moves cursor to previous file it was on, but the list does not show it correctly (move list)
	[X]'Hidden' toggle button should represent current state. (toggle button)
	[X]Dir up in root ('/') dir shows weird behaviour. Cursor leaves focus and does not stay on previous dir.
	[X]Entering a dir with lots of files (/usr/share/galeon/) leaves list scrolled wrong.
	[X]Error message when dir can't be read is shown twice
