This file lists changes from previous versions which might break upgrading or
should be taken notice of when installing Nimf.

v0.1.0
	The F6 is rename instead of move bug has been fixed. You'll have to 
	change the keysym for F6 to operation_move in the key-settings dialog or 
	remove your old ~/.nimf/keys config.

v0.0.18
	Various stuff changed in all the configuration files. You'll have to 
	delete them, so nimf can create new ones. Sorry. 

	You won't have to use the configuration examples anymore. Nimf will create
	new configurations itself for you.

v0.0.17
	In this release the format for the 'main' configuration has changed. To
	upgrade your configuration file to this new format, you need to open the
	'Misc' setting from the 'Settings' menu, and toggle EACH toggle TWICE. 
	(I know, it's butt-ugly, but who cares really?) After this, restart nimf,
	and you should be OK.
