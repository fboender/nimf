[%%VERSION] <%%EMAIL> ( %%DATE )
  * 

[0.1.1] <%%EMAIL> ( Sun Apr  4 12:44:06 CEST 2004 )
  * Panel     : Optimizations in the calling of panel_info_update. Makes large
                selections faster.
  * Panel     : Refresh can now be forced so complete dir is reread instead of 
                diffed with in-memory version.
  * Operations: Current file that is being worked on is now shown in progress.
  * Operations: Added chmod dialog and functionality.
  * Operations: Added chmod dialog and functionality.

[0.1.0] <%%EMAIL> ( Wed May 14 18:22:31 CEST 2003 )
  * Config    : The F6 is rename instead of move bug has been fixed. You'll
                have to change the keysym for F6 to operation_move in the 
                key-settings dialog or remove your old ~/.nimf/keys config.
  * Panel     : Bug fix for the bug where hidden files wouldn't show. 
                panel->showhiddenfiles is now initialized at 0.

[0.0.21] <%%EMAIL> ( Mon May  5 15:33:05 CEST 2003 )
  * Panel     : Letters are no longer added to jumpsearch if they yield no 
                result.
  * Panel     : Fixed the toggle-hidden-button bug in which the key-combo for
                toggling hidden file-view wouldn't work because it recursively
                triggered the 'clicked' event for the button, which in turn 
                called the panel_toggle_hidden() function. The key handling
                now just emits a clicked signal.
  * Jumpsearch: Fixed bug where you couldn't search for files starting with
                a period.
  * Config    : Fixed buffer overflow bug in config_get_key()
  * Settings  : Multiple user interface enhancements were made. Keyboard 
                handling is better. Correct fields are autoamtically focussed.
  * Cmdline   : Initial version of the commandline bar.
  * Cmdline   : Added key sym for focussing the commandline. (focus_cmdline)
  * Cmdline   : Output bar added.
  * Cmdline   : Escape now returns you to the panel.
  * Cmdline   : Output is now shown for commands.
  * Cmdline   : Added functions for opening/closing/toggling the cmdline output.
  * Nimf      : Main widget creation adapted for separator with dragbutton.
                output bar can now be enlarged.

  * Nimf      : Fixed jump search bug due to new key configuration scheme.
  * Panel     : Fixed 'sort dirs case sensitive' setting. It was reversed.
  * Panel     : Fixed bug where keys wouldn't work if numlock was turned on.
  * Panel     : Optimizations in the panel refresh routine.
  * Panel     : Made improvements (I hope) on the panel scrolling routines
                after updates in the panel.

  * Settings  : User interface for 'misc' settings added. (crude)
  * Panel     : Fixed beep when displaying keys during jumpsearch
  * Panel     : 'Hidden' is now a toggle button.
  
  -- 0.0.17 was released two times, due to mispackaging. The faulty 
  package was online for only a couple of hours, so I didn't bother to
  update the version number.

[v0.0.16] <%%EMAIL> ( Tue Jan 28 00:09:33 CET 2003 )
  * File      : Progress is now reported after a part of the operation has
                completed.
  * Panel     : Path entry at the top of the panels is now automatically 
                selected when focussing using the keysym (ctrl-l).
  * Panel     : Going one dir up when in root ('/') bugs fixed (cursor would
                leave panel, etc)
  * Config    : If no configuration exists, nimf automatically creates a 
                default one in the user's home dir.
  * Panel     : Added bookmarks support.
  * Panel     : Fixed scrolling to right of file list when calling dirup and the
                dir contained a large filename. Problem caused by GDK_Left, which
                scrolled the list somehow.

[v0.0.15] <%%EMAIL> ( Mon Jan 6 20:35:20 CET 2002 )
  * Panel     : Added keysym for focusing the pathentry textbox.
  * Panel     : Fixed segfault in jumpsearch backspace routine.

                working buttons, instead of just text.
  * Panel     : During operations, panels will not be updated. This
                increases speed.
  * Panel     : Current active panel is now remembered through sessions.
  * Panel     : Added pattern file selection. Use grey-plus and grey-minus.
  * Dialogs   : Text in entry widgets is now automatically selected when
                dialog first pops up, so text can immediatelly be overwritten.
  * Panel     : Keysym for hidden toggle and Home button.
  * Dialogs   : Removed 'cancel' button from dialog_error(), since it
                was useless.
  * Config    : Added configuration option 'show_keys' (yes/no) for showing
                the currently pressed key. This is temporary for the lack of
                keysym-editor.

[v0.0.14] <%%EMAIL> ( Sun Dec 15 18:35:45 CET 2002 )
  * Removed various debugging messages from source

  * Updated the Makefile, it now uses some variables, etc.
  * Panel     : Fixed memory leak in panel_refresh_timeout().

                rebuild the complete list, but removes/adds/updates instead.

                no more.

                more uniform and added 'cancel' button to operations.
  * File      : Fixed bug where dir_del would not adhere to 'cancel' actions.
  * Panel     : If refresh failed (dir couldn't be read), panel staid frozen
                witch caused problems.
  * Panel     : Built panel_change_dir wrapper function for changing dirs in 
                panels which takes care of any failed directory readings.

[v0.0.12] <%%EMAIL> ( Mon Aug 26 19:08:37 CEST 2002 )
  * Operations: Added a quick hack for renaming files (ctrl-f6).
  * Operations: Default behaviour is not to resolve symlinks during operations.
